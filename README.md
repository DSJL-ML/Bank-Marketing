# Bank-Marketing
Build machine learning algorithms for bank telemarketing.

## Summary
A dataset collected from a Portuguese retail bank is based upon to build machine learning models to predict clients who are likely to subscribe a term deposit after contacted by bank agents through phone calls. The python code execution is in [bank-marketing.html](https://github.com/ljj-ml/Bank-Marketing/blob/master/bank-marketing.html) and project report is in [project_report.pdf](https://github.com/ljj-ml/Bank-Marketing/blob/master/project_report.pdf).
